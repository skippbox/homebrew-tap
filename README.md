# Skippbox Homebrew tap

Install skippbox software via [homebrew](http://brew.sh) on OSX.

## Usage

You can either directly install a software with:

    $ brew install skippbox/tap/kmachine

Or add the Skippbox tap to your Homebrew installation:

    $ brew tap skippbox/tap
    $ brew install kmachine

GUI apps (like Skippbox), will need Homebrew Cask to be installed to works (asuming you added our tap as demonstrated in the previous steps:

    $ brew tap caskroom/cask
    $ brew cask install skippbox
